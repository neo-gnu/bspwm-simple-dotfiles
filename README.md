# BSPWM Window Manager - X11 

### Welcome to my simple configuration
This is my personal WM, it's very simple that works in your potato hardware! :D

There is no effects, this is simple and direct for my usage, because I'm lazier person!! when we're talking personalization zZ

I will update this dotfile in future when I get my environment better, I still have to add some apps such as VIM Editor and plugins.
